# Delta Roof Price Calculator

A modern, responsive web application for calculating roof softwash pricing based on horizontal area and slope factors. Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, featuring dark mode support and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- üìê Interactive roof pitch diagram
- üåì Dark/Light mode toggle
- üí° Tooltips with detailed slope information
- ‚ú® Smooth animations and transitions
- üìã Copy results to clipboard
- üì± Fully responsive design

## Calculation Method

The calculator uses a 4-tier categorization system for roof slopes:

| Category | Description  | Pitch Range | Multiplier |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| A | Low Slope    | ‚â§ 3/12     | 1.03 |
| B | Standard     | 4/12 - 6/12 | 1.12 |
| C | Steep        | 7/12 - 9/12 | 1.25 |
| D | Very Steep   | ‚â• 10/12    | 1.41 |

### Price Calculation

1. Calculate actual roof surface area:
   ```
   ActualArea = HorizontalArea √ó SlopeFactor
   ```

2. Calculate minimum price:
   ```
   MinimumPrice = ActualArea √ó $0.50
   ```
